Alert Buddy

Alert Buddy is a Wearable Emergency Alerting Device for the Hearing Impaired. This is a part of the 4th year engineering project.

The objective of this project is to construct a wearable system that will assist users who wish to be alerted by specific alarming sounds in the surrounding area, by employing environmental sound classification techniques to process the sounds on a peripheral device specifically designed for low power consumption and handle real-time computing, and transmitting the collected information through Bluetooth Low Energy technology to the userâ€™s mobile device to notify the user through visual display or vibration patterns.

- The wearable device collects the surrounding sounds and send it to the mobile application using BLE.
- The android application receives the raw data, identifies the sound using environmental sound classification techniques. The app then displays the sound on the screen and notifies the wearable of the identified sound to be displayed on the wearble screen as well.
- The wearble device settings can be configured on the app.
